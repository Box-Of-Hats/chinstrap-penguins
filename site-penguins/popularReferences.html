                    Penguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually
                    upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and (compared to
                    other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their black-and-white
                    plumage is often likened to a white tie suit. Some artists
                    and writers have penguins based at the North Pole, but there
                    are no wild penguins in the Arctic. The cartoon series
                    Chilly Willy helped perpetuate this myth, as the title
                    penguin would interact with Arctic or subarctic species,
                    such as polar bears and walruses.

                    Penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such
                    as Happy Feet, Surf's Up and The Penguins of Madagascar, all
                    CGI films; March of the Penguins, a documentary based on the
                    migration process of the emperor penguin; and a parody
                    titled Farce of the Penguins. Mr. Popper's Penguins is a
                    children's book written by Richard and Florence Atwater; it
                    was named a Newbery Honor Book in 1939. Penguins have also
                    appeared in a number of cartoons and television dramas,
                    including Pingu, created by Silvio Mazzola in 1986 and
                    covering more than 100 short episodes. At the end of 2009,
                    Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade,
                    "best-of" list, saying, "Whether they were walking (March of
                    the Penguins), dancing (Happy Feet), or hanging ten (Surf's
                    Up), these oddly adorable birds took flight at the box
                    office all decade long."[80]

                    A video game called Pengo was released by Sega in 1982. Set
                    in Antarctica, the player controls a penguin character who
                    must navigate mazes of ice cubes. The player is rewarded
                    with cut-scenes of animated penguins marching, dancing,
                    saluting and playing peekaboo. Several remakes and enhanced
                    editions have followed, most recently in 2012. Penguins are
                    also sometimes depicted in music.[81]

                    In 1941, DC Comics introduced the avian-themed character of
                    The Penguin as a supervillain adversary of the superhero
                    Batman (Detective Comics #58). He became one of the most
                    enduring enemies in Batman's rogue's gallery. In the 60s
                    Batman TV series, as played by Burgess Meredith, he was one
                    of the most popular characters, and in Tim Burton's
                    reimagining of the character in the 1992 film Batman
                    Returns, he employed an actual army of penguins (mostly
                    African penguins).

                    Several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in
                    the United States have named themselves after the species,
                    including the Pittsburgh Penguins team in the National
                    Hockey League and the Youngstown State Penguins in college
                    athletics.

                    Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of UK cartoonist
                    Steve Bell in his strip in The Guardian newspaper,
                    particularly during and following the Falklands War. Opus
                    the Penguin, from the cartoons of Berkeley Breathed, is also
                    described as hailing from the Falklands. Opus was a comical,
                    "existentialist" penguin character in the cartoons Bloom
                    County, Outland and Opus. He was also the star in the
                    Christmas show A Wish for Wings That Work.
