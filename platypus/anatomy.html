            Platypuses range in length from 38 to 60 cm (15 to 24 inches); males are generally larger than females.
            Aquatic adaptations include the flat streamlined body, dorsally placed eyes and nostrils, and dense
            waterproof fur that keeps the platypus well insulated.
            Long guard hairs protect the soft underfur, which remains dry even after hours in the water. The extensive
            webbing on the front feet extends well past the claws
            and is essential in propelling the animal through the water. The paddlelike tail acts as a stabilizer during
            swimming, while the back feet act as rudders and brakes.

            Odd skeletal features of platypuses include an archaic robust shoulder girdle and a short, wide humerus
            providing extensive muscle attachment areas for the exceptionally strong front limbs. The outside of the
            bill is covered by soft, sensitive skin. Inside the bill, adult platypuses do not have true teeth but
            instead have developed flat pads of hardened gum tissue. Male platypuses have a spur on the inner side of
            each ankle that is connected to a venom gland located over the thighs. The spurs can be wielded in defense,
            and the venom is potent enough to kill small animals and cause intense pain in humans if the spur penetrates
            the skin.
