            The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the water foraging for food. When
            swimming, it can be distinguished from other Australian mammals by the absence of visible ears. Uniquely
            among mammals, it propels itself when swimming by an alternate rowing motion of the front feet; although all
            four feet of the platypus are webbed, the hind feet (which are held against the body) do not assist in
            propulsion, but are used for steering in combination with the tail.[54] The species is endothermic,
            maintaining its body temperature at about 32 째C (90 째F), lower than most mammals, even while foraging for
            hours in water below 5 째C (41 째F).
        </p>

            Dives normally last around 30 seconds, but can last longer, although few exceed the estimated aerobic limit
            of 40 seconds. Recovery at the surface between dives commonly takes from 10 to 20 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            When not in the water, the platypus retires to a short, straight resting burrow of oval cross-section,
            nearly always in the riverbank not far above water level, and often hidden under a protective tangle of
            roots.
        </p>
        <p>
            The average sleep time of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours per day, possibly because it eats
            crustaceans, which provide a high level of calories.
